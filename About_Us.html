				<p class="header-text" id="Subheader-text">"In most households a cup of coffee is considered the one thing needful at the breakfast hour. But how often this exhilarating beverage, that “comforteth the brain and heateth and helpeth digestion” is made muddy and ill-flavoured! … You may roast the berries “to the queen’s taste,” and grind them fresh every morning, and yet, if the golden liquid be not prepared in the most immaculate of coffee-pots, with each return of morning, a new disappointment awaits you.”<br></p>
